# Learning Neural Networks

 Some notebooks that I wrote back in December 2018 when trying to learn the mathematical theory behind artificial neural networks. The book I learned is from this [website](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html). The author also walks you through creating an ANN from scratch, which I have also attempted with the help of his code.
